# Market-Segmentation
Marketing is required to meet the demands of both suppliers and consumer. A marketing plan
consist of planning the marketing objectives and strategies to fulfil those objectives. A
marketing plan consists of two components: a strategic and a tactical marketing plan. The
strategic plan takes care of the long-term direction of an organisation whereas tactical
marketing outlines the detail on short-term marketing action required to move in this long-term
direction. The strategic marketing plan states where the organisation wants to go and why. The
tactical marketing plan contains instructions on what can be done to get there. The strategic
marketing plan identifies consumer needs and desires, strengths and weaknesses internal to the
organisation, and external opportunities and threats the organisation may face. It helps in
identifying what the supplier is particularly suitable to offer consumers. Two key decisions are
made as part of the strategic marketing planning process
